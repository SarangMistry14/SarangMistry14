<div style="text-align: justify">


Hello! I'm **Sarang Mistry**, a dedicated Computer Science student at the University of Houston, set to graduate in December 2024. My expertise spans across **Web Development**, **Data Science**, and **Artificial Intelligence**, where I strive to create innovative solutions that solve real-world problems. 

With a strong foundation in **full-stack development** and a passion for AI-driven projects, I enjoy exploring the latest technologies and applying them to my work.
